# MXNet's Ecosystem

Community contributions to MXNet have added many new valuable features and functionality to support use cases such as model serving & portability, easy and flexible APIs, and educational material like crash courses and online books. This ecosystem page lists the projects that use MXNet, teach MXNet, or augment MXNet in some way.

## Learning MXNet and other Educational Resources

* [Gluon 60 Minute Crash Course](https://gluon-crash-course.mxnet.io/) - deep learning practitioners can learn Gluon quickly with these six 10-minute tutorials.
* [The Straight Dope](https://gluon.mxnet.io/) - a series of notebooks designed to teach deep learning using the Gluon Python API for MXNet.


## New MXNet APIs

* [Clojure API](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/tree/master/contrib/clojure-package) - use MXNet with Clojure.
* [Gluon Python Interface](../gluon/index.html) - train complex models imperatively and then deploy with a symbolic graph.
* [ONNX-MXnet API](../api/python/contrib/onnx.html) - train and use Open Neural Network eXchange (ONNX) model files.
* [Scala Infer API](../api/scala/infer.html) - model loading and inference functionality.


## Toolkits to Extend MXNet

* [Gluon CV](https://gluon-cv.mxnet.io/) - state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms in computer vision.
* [Gluon NLP](https://gluon-nlp.mxnet.io/) - state-of-the-art deep learning models in natural language processing.


## Model Serving

* [MXNet Model Server (MMS)](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/tree/master/example/model-server/mms.md) - simple yet scalable solution for model inference.


## Model Zoos

* [Gluon Model Zoo](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/api/python/gluon/model_zoo.html) - models trained in Gluon and available through Gluon's model zoo API.
* [ONNX Model Zoo](https://github.com/onnx/model-zoo) - ONNX models from a variety of ONNX-supported frameworks.


## MXNet as a Backend

* [Keras-MXNet](https://github.com/awslabs/keras-apache-mxnet) - design with Keras2 and train with MXNet as the backend for 2x or more speed improvement.


## Contributions

Do you know of a project or resource in the MXNet ecosystem that should be listed here? Or would you like to get involved by providing your own contribution? Check out the [guide for contributing to MXNet](contribute.html), and browse the [design proposals](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/MXNET/Design+Proposals) to see what others are working on. You might find something you would like to help with or use those design docs as a template for your own proposal. Use one of the [developer communication channels](https://mxnet.incubator.apache.org/community/contribute.html#mxnet-dev-communications) if you would like to know more, or [create a GitHub issue](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/issues/new) if you would like to propose something for the MXNet ecosystem.
