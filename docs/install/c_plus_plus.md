## Build the C++ package
The C++ package has the same prerequisites as the MXNet library.

To enable C++ package, just add `USE_CPP_PACKAGE=1` in the [build from source](build_from_source.html) options when building the MXNet shared library.

## C++ Example Code
You can find C++ code examples in the `cpp-package/example` folder of the MXNet project. Refer to the [cpp-package's README](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/tree/master/cpp-package) for instructions on building the examples.
